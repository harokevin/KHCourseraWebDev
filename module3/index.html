While the dish is very popular in the United States, it is most often found as a variation of General Tso's chicken in America rather than the dish found in mainland China.</div>

      	<div class="section-text">The word sashimi means "pierced body", i.e. "刺身 = sashimi, where 刺し = sashi (pierced, stuck) and 身 = mi (body, meat). The culture of eating raw fish started in China as early as 500 BCE and the delicacy arrived in Japan during the Heian Period. [1] This word dates from the Muromachi period, and was possibly coined when the word "切る = kiru (cut), the culinary step, was considered too inauspicious to be used by anyone other than samurai.[citation needed] This word may derive from the culinary practice of sticking the fish's tail and fin to the slices in identifying the fish being eaten.</div>

        <div class="section-title">Swimming Rama</div>
        <div class="section-text">The name of this recipe is Swimming Rama and comes from a Thai cookbook I recently picked up. I don't know what Swimming Rama means, but I will translate it to chicken in the most delicious peanut sauce EVER. This meal is a little bit more involved than others, so I made it over the weekend when I had plenty of time to cook. I made the full recipe of the peanut sauce but only 1 chicken breast.</div>

Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, from the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu to the miso ramen of Hokkaido.</div>
